Another great book written by the creator of C++ is Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. though it contains all the basic concepts of C++, it would not be a suitable pick for you if you’ve just started out with the object-oriented programming language.

Those who have even little practical experience with C++ and know how to do basic coding and the way data structure and algorithms can start with this book. In this book, Stroustrup mostly focused on coding skills.
